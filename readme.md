## Machine Learning Final

by Matt Kosack and Mark Morykan

This was the final project for the Machine Learning course.

See the dogs.ipynb notebook for the code.

This was run on google colab to use their resources, so the loading code will have to be changed based on where its being run.

There were also way too many images to load (it would crash my colab session), so the results of this are pretty bad.

Many blocks are commented out because we wanted to make sure our best models would run and the memory was not eaten by other models.

Also, the organization is horrible because we were trying so many different things and it would crash a lot, so when something worked we went with it and ignored lots of things.

You can look at the doc pictures [here](https://mattkosack.github.io/dogs)
(I'm using the github api to request random images, but because of this structure it uses 2 api calls per click. Without an api key you only get 60 calls, so you'll only get 30 dogs per hour. Eventually this should be hosted somewhere else, but GitHub Pages is free.)

Also, [this is where the pics came from](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset)
