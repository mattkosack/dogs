Since I don't know of a great way to access the images without hosting them somewhere myself, I use the GitHub API to access the images in this public repo. Each click uses 2 api calls and without an api key, GitHub limits you to 60 calls per hour. (So naturally, there is very little use for now)

(Yes, I could probably host the images on my own small server or something, but that's more work than it's worth for this.)

Also, [this is where the pics came from](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset)
