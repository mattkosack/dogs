## Machine Learning Final

by Matt Kosack and Mark Morykan

This was the final project for the Machine Learning course.

See the dogs.ipynb notebook for the code.

This was run on google colab to use their resources, so the loading code will have to be changed based on where its being run.

There were also way too many images to load (it would crash my colab session), so the results of this are pretty bad.

You can look at the doc pictures [here](https://mattkosack.github.io/dogs)
(I'm using the github api to request random images, but because of this structure it uses 2 api calls per click. Without an api key you only get 60 calls, so you'll only get 30 dogs per hour. Eventually this should be hosted somewhere else, but GitHub Pages is free.)

Also, [this is where the pics came from](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset)
